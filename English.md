## resource fragmentation

In network virtualization environments, with random arrival and departure of virtual network requests, there exist some resources (i.e., link resources and node resources) isolated from others in substrate networks. This phenomenon is referred to as resource fragmentation

## VNE

One of the critical problems in network virtualization is to map virtual nodes and virtual links of requested virtual networks into a shared substrate network. This problem is known as the virtual network embedding (VNE) problem.

Inspired by the recent success of graph convolutional network (GCN) in graph structured data processing, in this paper, we propose a GCN aided VNE algorithm.
